# Events

## Defining events

With events you can do actions before or after reading and writing of document data. Examples of such behavior:
- Writing fields that require updates everytime the document is updated (like a lowercased version of a name or a array for searching).
- Getting documents out of a subcollection when reading a document.

You can define events with the `defineEvent` method that you an optionally import when defining your `definition` method.

Available events are:
- `beforeWrite`: will be fired before your document is stored to the Firestore database.
- `beforeRead`: will be fired before your document is read from the Firestore database.
- `afterWrite`: will be fired after the write to your Firestore database is complete.
- `afterRead`: will be fired after the read from your Firestore database is complete.

```ts
export class City extends DocumentClass {
  name!: string
  lowercasedName!: string

  // highlight-start
  definition({ define, defineCollection, defineHandler, defineEvent }: DocumentClassDefineProps): void {
    // highlight-end
    define("name", "string", "")
    define("lowercasedName", "string", "")

    // highlight-start
    defineEvent("beforeWrite", () => {
      this.lowercasedName = this.name.toLowerCase()
    })
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

## Async events

Events support async event handlers if you need to execute async actions or Firestore datbase actions.
Keep in mind that async event handlers will slow down reading or writing of document classes as the handler needs to be executed first.

```ts
export class City extends DocumentClass {
  name!: string
  hashedName!: string

  definition({ define, defineCollection, defineHandler, defineEvent }: DocumentClassDefineProps): void {
    define("name", "string", "")
    define("hashedName", "string", "")

    // highlight-start
    defineEvent("beforeWrite", async () => {
      this.hashedName = await promiseBasedMethod(this.name)
    })
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```
