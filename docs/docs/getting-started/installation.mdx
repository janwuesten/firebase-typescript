# Installation

:::note
Before using Firebase TypeScript you should be familiar with the core concepts of Firebase and Firestore and ideally already used Firebase before.
If you do not know the core concepts of Firebase and how Firebase works, please consider reading the official docs [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs) before starting with Firebase TypeScript.

However this doesn't mean that you can't start building your first project using Firebase TypeScript as the core concepts of Firebase TypeScript are easy to understand.
:::

## Install for Web

First, install the official Firebase for Web SDK according to the Firebase docs [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

Then install the Firebase TypeScript package `@janwuesten/firebase-typescript` to your web project.

`npm i @janwuesten/firebase-typescript`

## Install for your Server

First, install the official Firebase Admin SDK according to the Firebase docs [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).

Then install the Firebase TypeScript package `@janwuesten/firebase-typescript` to your web project.

`npm i @janwuesten/firebase-typescript`

## Install for React Native

Install the React Native Firebase SDK made by Invertase according to its documentation [here](https://rnfirebase.io/).
Firebase TypeScript requires the installation of the core React Native Firebase SDK as well as the React Native Firestore SDK.

Then install the Firebase TypeScript package `@janwuesten/firebase-typescript` to your web project.

`npm i @janwuesten/firebase-typescript`

:::tip
If you have Metro running we recommend starting metro with cleared cache with `react-native start --reset-cache` or `npm start -- --reset-cache` to minimize errors due to the cache.

## Supported SDK versions

Due to the way Firebase TypeScript is developed, every version of the Firebase SDKs (older, current and future) versions should work without problems.
However this doesn't mean every version is officially supported by us. If you use unsupported versions some features may not work and you will not receive support by us.
