# Performance

Using Firebase TypeScript will obviously make a small performance impact.
This is why we made a small information about when to use Firebase TypeScript and when to better not use it as well as some metrics to let you decide better.

## When to use Firebase TypeScript

Firebase TypeScript is perfect if you want a consistent, readable, maintainable and shareable class pattern to use with your Firestore database.
As the Firestore database does not provide any scheme your code is the only instance defining your scheme.
So using this sort of class pattern is useful to reduce bugs and improve your product stability for the end user.

## When not to use Firebase TypeScript

As Firebase TypeScript has some performance impact especially when using a huge amount of class documents at the same time
using it in heavy tasks that are reading or writing heavy amount of documents (> 10000 or more) isn't ideal.

Firebase TypeScript is also not ideal for applications where every 0,01ms counts - for example in Games.

## Performance metrics

To provide some data, we have compared "native performance" (using plain JavaScript Objects) with the usage of `DocumentClass`.
The `DocumentClass` included one `DocumentMap`.

:::note
Keep in mind that the result vary depending on the system, class structure and other factors.
Those performance impacts are only for writing and reading documents and not for working with the documents.
:::

| Test | Runs | Average time | Total time |
|--|--|--|--|
| Native / no classes | 1 | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| `DocumentClass` write | 1 | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| `DocumentClass` read | 1 | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Native / no classes | 100 | 1ms | 0.001ms |
| `DocumentClass` write | 100 | 1ms | 0.001ms |
| `DocumentClass` read | 100 | 1ms | 0.001ms |
| Native / no classes | 1000 | 0.001ms | 1ms |
| `DocumentClass` write | 1000 | 0.003 | 3ms |
| `DocumentClass` read | 1000 | 0.015 | 15ms |

:::info
In a future release we plan to provide a `LightweightDocumentClass` and `LightweightDocumentMap` with less features than `DocumentClass` and `DocumentMap` but near native performance.
