# Reading documents

## Reading a document by ID

Reading documents by the document ID requires that you know the document ID.
It is the most simple way of reading documents from your Firestore database.

Note that reading non existing documents does not throw an error. Instead it returns `false` on the `get` method.
When a document is not found, the default values will be used for the properties.

```ts
try {
  const city = new City("document id")
  if (await city.get()) {
    // document does exist
  } else {
    // document does not exist
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.warn(err)
}
```

:::tip
If you want to throw an error when a document is not found, you can always add a throw statement to the else block.

## Search (query) for documents

To search (query) for documents, you first need to create a query snapshot with your Firebase SDK that you can then pass to a `DocumentFactory` that will then return a array of found document classes.
