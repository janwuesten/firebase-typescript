# Writing documents

## Adding documents

Adding documents can be done by simply using the `add` method. This will generate an ID and will add the ID to the existing `DocumentClass` reference.

```ts
const myNewCity = new City()
await myNewCity.add()
console.log(`new created document id is ${myNewCity.id}`)
```

## Setting documents

Setting documents is a bit more complex than adding documents.
If no ID is provided, the `set` method will add a new document and update the ID similar to the `add` method.
If a ID is provided, the `set` method will set the document with the given ID, replacing the existing document but not failing when the document does not exist.
When adding `merge: true` as a set option, the document is either merged with the existing document, or created using the provided ID.
You can [read more information about set in the official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data?hl=de#set_a_document) if you need to.

```ts
// Without an ID (create document)
const myNewCity = new City()
await myNewCity.set()
console.log(`new created document id is ${myNewCity.id}`)

// With an ID (replacing document)
const myCity = new City("my-document-id")
await myCity.set()

// With an ID (merging document)
const myCity = new City("my-document-id")
await myCity.set({ merge: true })
```

## Updating documents

Updating documents can be done by using the `update` method and is the recommended way of updating document that you know exist. Keep in mind that `update` will fail if the document does not exist. If you don't know if the document exists you should probably use `set` with the `merge: true` option instead.

```ts
const myCity = new City("my-document-id")
if (myCity.get()) {
  await myCity.update()
}
```

## Deleting documents

Deleting documents can be done by using the `delete` method. Note that the method will fail if no document ID is provided.

```ts
const myCity = new City("my-document-id")
await myCity.delete()
```
